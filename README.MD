## Synthetic task

Draw a random probability vector over all K^D joint outcomes from a Dirichlet(1) prior — this gives a "full-rank" joint distribution with arbitrary correlations between dimensions. A factorized categorical base can only  capture the marginals, so the gap (mutual information) is what the model has to close by  learning modular-addition relabelings that decorrelate the dimensions.
